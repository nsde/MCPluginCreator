# MCPluginCreator
Create Minecraft Plugins without programming!

> Currently **NOT compatible with ATERNOS!**
> We apologize, but we can't do anything about that. 

> Reasons:
> 1. Aternos does not allow the a creation of a file in the root server directory.
> 2. Aternos does not allow the upload of files

# How to install the prorgam itself
Both the programm itself and the plugins it creates are written in Python.
For normal installation, go to **/releases**, for very unstable developement versions, go to **Code** -> Download ZIP.
